## Intro to RPGs
If you’ve played tabletop RPGs before, feel free to skip to “Intro to Spyder”, otherwise heres a few important things to keep in mind that apply to all social role playing games.

* **Collaboration and Cooperation** – Roleplaying games are by nature both collaborative and cooperative. By that I mean, all the players at the table are working toward the same goal of creating a certain kind of experience. That experience may be competitive. The players may make the decision to pit a list of characters against each other in a fight to the death, or they may design and run nations seeking to dominate the others. In both examples the characters of the story may mean the other character's ill, but the players at the table are cooperating amd agree to create that experience.
* **Boundaries and Consent** - The players you share the game with come from different backgrounds and with different baggage. Their baggage might not make sense to you, but it isn't important for you to understand why something makes someone uncomfortable. It is important for you to simply recognize their boundaries and not cross them. This will be easier if boundaries are discussed before the game begins. If you ever aren't sure if certain content will make someone uncomfortable, it will never hurt to check in with someone and make sure they consent in taking part, even if it breaks immersion.
* **Trust and Respect** – It is impossible to play a collaborative storytelling game without sharing trust and respect between the players. Trust that the players will respect each other's boundaries. Trust that the players are cooperating with each other to create the same experience. Respecting a player's decision when playing their role. If you ever find that you aren't sure if you trust or respect the other players, consider talking about why. It is possible that the experience you want to create isn't the same as the other players, and it may be that you don't consent to certain content being brought up. Sometimes a compromise can be made for the betterment of the whole group. Sometimes it might be best to find a new group. Don't play in a group that you don't trust or respect, or doesn't trust or respect you. If that is the case, you aren't having fun, and games are supposed to be fun.

## Intro to Spyder
There are many ways to play a roleplaying game. Some games are highly tactical and every decision made may influence the outcome of your hit points so optimizing is your best bet. Some games focus on problem solving where resources are just pieces of the puzzle. This game attempts to scratch those itches and many more, with a **high emphasis on storytelling**. Spyder is not a series of challenges for the player to win, but instead a story to be told. Because the focus is telling a good story the rules are not written in such a way to bar someone from exploiting certain play-styles to their advantage. That is a story you have the option to explore. The players win when they all share in a good story.

Spyder also takes concepts and ideas from many other role-playing games, and replaces them with simpler and easier to understand rules. **This system is targeted at players who have never played a role-playing game before**, and veterans alike. With the rules simplified, it not only makes the game easier to understand, but it also opposes interruptions to the flow of the story, allowing players to explore complex concepts without having to think too much about what is and isn't allowed.

This rulebook in particular is supposed to provide the bare-bones rules necessary for any story being told. Because of that, **no setting is assumed** by the rules that are provided. I intend to make supplemental material that provides optional rules for fantasy, horror, or sci-fi settings. At the time of me writing this, this is the first book being written for this system. I personally encourage you to make your own setting for Spyder collaboratively as a group. It gives you a place of familiarity to begin the game with, and a blank canvas to explore when you need more resources. This book however is not going to tell you how to build a world or write a story. There are much better resources for that.

**Spyder also doesn't assume the type of story being told**. The rules should be equally effective at telling a story about an epic conquest of soldiers battling monsters to the death, as it is at telling a story about a teenager trying desperately to find an adolescent understanding of life while pursuing their presumed soul mate's affection in book club. Characters can reach the depth that the player's want them to reach.

Because there is no setting or story type, you may find some rules that aren't relevant to the story you are telling, or perhaps you simply don't like. You may also fail to find rules for things you would like to roleplay, or just have rules from other games you enjoy. **It's never a problem to ignore certain rules or add your own**. Just make sure the group agrees to it. If the group has an agreed upon set of rules, and one player begins ignoring that set, then they are no longer playing cooperatively as described in the previous chapter.

## The Players
**There are two groups of players** in Spyder. One group is assigned their own characters to create and manage as main characters in the story. This first group will often simply be referred to as **"the players."** However sometimes when the phrase "the players" is used it will be referring to both groups. Use your best judgement as to which I am referring to.

The other group of players are referred to as the **"narrators."** The narrators create and control all of the other characters of the story and aren't bound by the same character creation rules laid out in this book. They are in charge of the overall narrative, and their objective is to weave the players' decisions together into one cohesive story. Their role isn't dissimilar to that of a "game master" in other games. They decide when a die roll is or isn't necessary, and they decide what happens as a result of those rolls. The narrators may tell the story how they see fit, regardless of any players’ actions, any die rolls, or any rules laid out in this book. They may make their own rules, and they may choose not to adhere to them.

It is important to only allow someone you trust to narrate. The narrator has the authority to change the story for better or worse, and therefore has great potential to spoil a game. Their goal should be to make the game fun for all the players involved, including themselves. Keep in mind that good stories have ups and downs, so a good narrator might make some scenes less fun than others to accentuate the better ones. Don’t make hasty judgements based on individual scenes, but allow narrators to both prove themselves, and grow.

The vocabulary of this book assumes that there are multiple "players" at your table, and only one "narrator." However, any number of players can fit into these two groups to fit the needs of any story.

## How to Play
As a collaborative experience, everyone at the table will take turns narrating a part of the story when appropriate. The players each have a character with unique proficiencies who they roleplay, and the narrator interprets the players’ expressed desires and narrates the scenes accordingly.

It may be important to distinguish a characters' thoughts and actions from the players' at times. Because of this, it is always appropriate for a player to "break character" and ask questions or share information as themselves before returning to the role of their character.

One common pattern of gameplay may look like the following.

1. The narrator introduces the scene and its environment.
1. A player expresses what their character wants to do in the scene
1. The narrator describes the character’s action and the result of that action
1. Return to step 2

There may be occasions where the narrator will want to leave the outcome of a scene to chance. When this is the case, the narrator will roll a die, or tell a player to roll a die. The narrator will choose a “Target Number” (TN), and determine one outcome that will occur if the die lands below that number (the character fails), and a different outcome if the die lands on or above that number (the character succeeds).

**A proficiency roll is when a player rolls a d20, and adds all of the proficiencies their character has that are narratively relevant to the result of that roll**. That may have sounded like a mouth-full, so let me explain:

Every character has a list of proficiencies. These are easy to keep track of on a sheet of paper. The narrator may ask a player to roll to see if their character can jump across a deep pit. That player rolls a d20, then looks at their sheet. They have a list of proficiencies. They pick out all the ones that would be relevant to their character's ability to jump across a deep pit. Those proficiencies have set numeric values. The player adds those values together, then adds the result of their d20 roll. The player tells the narrator the total, and the narrator relays whether that number was high enough to meet their TN or not. Then the narrator describes the scene as the character succeeds or fails at jumping across the hypothetical pit. The player does not need to relay to the narrator which proficiencies they used unless the narrator asks for them.

> If you are concerned about a player adding too many proficiencies to their rolls, making the rolls no longer exciting, consider putting a hard 15 point cap on proficiency bonuses.

For some proficiency rolls, the narrator may decide for themselves what the roll's TN is, but others may be left to chance and determined with a second roll. When a proficiency roll determines the TN for another proficiency roll this is called a contest. Contests are a great tool for a narrator to consider two characters competing in skills. For example, two characters may roll to determine the winner of an arm-wrestling match, or to see who can finish a crossword first.

>If you or your group doesn't have 20-sided dice available, or the numbers are too big for your players, then consider playing Spyder with classic 6-sided dice. When doing so, divide all the caps, LP, and other important numbers by 2. Those numbers will be explained later. Dividing by two will not get a perfectly scaled re-balance to match the die change, but as long as everyone is being reasonable about it, it shouldn't spoil anyone's fun.

## The Characters
Many characters make a story, but the player characters are the main characters. Not all stories' main characters are soldiers or wizards. The Deathstar was destroyed by a moisture farmer. I like stories about every-day people rising to greatness. That is why when creating a character you may want to consider what tropes you may be adhering to and why. It may be easy to engineer a character that never fails if that is the story you want to write, but it is also an option to make a character who's skills at first seem entirely irrelevant to the story. It may be fun to watch how they adapt.

## Character creation
When creating a character the concept is far more important than rules or "stats." There are better sources for learning character design, but try to at least give your character the basics like a flaw and a backstory.

Unlike many other RPGs, Spyder does not restrict characters to a "class" or "specialty." Instead, **Each player character starts out with 20 Learning Points (LP)**. The starting number of LP will influence the feel of the game. If the group wants their characters to feel more experienced or powerful, start with more LP. If the group wants their characters to feel weaker or less experienced, start with less. **Before the story begins, a character's respective player can freely spend LP on proficiencies**. LP can be invested and directly converted into proficiencies, but proficiencies can not exceed their cap.

The creation of side characters and antagonists follows the same principals. Choose a number of LP suited for the character's skills, then buy that character the proficiencies that make sense for the character.

### During character creation, please consider these stats
**Every character has 1 base hit point** which can be increased with proficiencies. A hit point is the number of mortal wounds a character can receive before dying.

**Every character has a base speed of 10 feet** which can be increased with proficiencies. A character's speed describes how fast they can confidently move in a paced challenge round, and does not dictate a character's movement outside of a paced challenge.

**Every character can passively carry 60 lbs** which can be increased by proficiencies. If a character wants to carry more than that, it may require a proficiency roll, and may hinder the character in some way (like not having hands available, or being slowed down).


>Narrator Tip: The narrator will inevitably find themselves in a situation where they need to have a character ready fast. When this comes up instead of preparing the character's proficiencies and other stats, simply make them up as they become narratively relevant. When one of these characters has to make a roll, just consider if they:
>* Are bad at what they are attempting (-5 to the roll)
>* Have never tried before (+0 to the roll)
>* Are good at it (+5 to the roll)
>* Are the best in town (+10)
>* Are famous (+15)

>If for some reason this character finds themselves in combat, consider the previous exercise in regards to their attack rolls. Then consider how many mortal wounds would be narratively appropriate for them to survive to determine their hit points. To determine their armor rating, consider the following:
>* Are they wearing no armor? (10AR)
>* Light armor? (12AR)
>* Medium? (14AR)
>* Heavy? (16AR)
>* Are they dexterous? (+2AR)
>* Do they have a shield? (+2AR)

## Character Advancement
**LP is rewarded for narratively significant moments like a knight attempting to slay a powerful monster, or a hacker attempting to breach a secure network. LP is rewarded whether the knight won or not, and whether the hacker was caught or not. LP is a reward for the attempt, and can be spent freely on proficiencies during any rest.**

>For a different experience, consider these variations on character advancement rules:
>* The same amount of LP is given every session regardless of the events in-game.
>* LP is granted every time a character kills something stronger than them.
>* LP is granted at predetermined points in the story by the narrator.
>* The characters can only spend LP at a narratively appropriate moment in the story. For example asking a craftsman for lessons at their craft so the player can buy some proficiency in their tools, or reading a book about a feat that the player wants to buy.
>* The characters can can spend LP freely just like during character creation.
>* Every city has a "trainer" where LP can be spent on proficiencies.
>
> For deeper customization, consider playing Spyder with percentile dice (sometimes referred to as a d100) instead of a d20. You could then multiply all of the caps, LP, and other important numbers by 5, allowing for a more intricate personalized experience.

## Proficiencies
A proficiency is a generalized number that all characters have that represents how skilled that character is in a certain area. The combination of proficiencies that a character has represents their talents, training, and natural abilities. This book only has a few proficiencies listed, but the possibilities are endless. Freely add proficiencies to your game that are more relevant. Just make sure to clear it with the other players first.

**When a player makes a proficiency roll, they get to add the values of all the proficiencies they think are relevant to that roll**, as explained in The Players chapter in further detail. **That means that the more broad and general proficiency is, the more valuable it is** because it will be relevant to more rolls. That is why **the 12 universal proficiencies (UPs) are the most important**. They are supposed to be the most broad proficiencies available for a character to put LP into, that is why when making a proficiency roll, a character is only allowed to add one UP to the roll, and all other proficiencies added must not be UPs. All of the proficiencies and what they do, including the 12 UPs are listed in the Proficiencies Archive.

>To give your characters a small boost of specialization, consider allowing each player to choose a "favorite" UP for their character. The chosen "favorite" UP's cap is increased by 1!

**Think of proficiencies like keywords that represent ideas. If the keyword or idea is relevant to the character's action, then the player can add that proficiency to the proficiency roll**. At times players may disagree on what proficiencies are actually relevant to a roll. When that is the case, the narrator will decide whether certain proficiencies may be added or not. It may be easy to argue your narrator into submission to max out your proficiencies every roll, but the narrator’s word is final, and playing that way isn't fun.

## Paced Challenge
A paced challenge is an intense moment in the story when timing is crucial to the outcome of a matter so it is kept track of in rounds. Each character engaged in a paced challenge gets one action, one quick action, and one movement. The number of feet a character can move in a round of a paced challenge is called their speed, and is affected by their proficiencies. A quick action is any activity that can be done quickly enough that it wouldn't interrupt a character's ability to perform an action in a round.

**A single round of a paced challenge should play out like this:**

1. All the players will take turns explaining what they are attempting to do.
1. The narrator will interpret the players’ desires, as well as the rest of the scene, and ask the players to make any rolls if necessary to achieve their goals.
1. The narrator will consider the outcome of those rolls, and describe how that round plays out.
1. If it is necessary to continue pacing the scene in this way, return to step 1.

During step 2, the narrator may also consider the actions and desires of other characters in the scene and make rolls for them as well. This is important to note when the nature of the challenge is competitive like combat.

Some actions that a character can take in a round are:

* Attack: Make a proficiency roll to attempt to harm another object or character
* Sprint: Move up to their speed in feet. (This can be done in addition to their standard movement.)
* Guard: Anticipate an attack or some other action that is about to be done to them. They get to add relevant proficiencies to the target's TN.

## Combat
Not all stories need to include combat, but for the ones that do, the combat can be very decisive in the outcome of the story. That is why there are so many combat related rules in this book. If your story may include combat, please consider the following:

Every character has a resource called "Hit Points" (HP). **HP represents the number of mortal wounds a character can receive before dying.**. If a character has 0 or fewer hit points, that character is now dead. Depending on your story, death may not be the end, so define what happens at 0 hit points before it comes up. When a character is inflicted with a mortal wound, they lose 1 hit point. Hit points can be restored by various means, but they can't surpass a character's "Maximum Hit Points" (Max HP).

A character's Max HP is how many HP they have when they've been inflicted by no wounds at all. **A character's Max Hit Points are equal to one plus their "Base Hit Points" (Base HP) proficiency plus their Skin Proficiency**.

**In order for a character to attack a target, they make a proficiency roll like all other rolls in the game**. Roll a d20, and add all the proficiencies relevant to the attack. The TN for the attack is equal to the target's "Armor Rating" (AR). If the roll succeeds, the target loses 1HP. If the die naturally rolls a 1, then the target loses no HP, even if the proficiencies are enough to reach the TN. If the die naturally rolls a 20, then the target loses 2HP, even if the proficiencies are not enough to reach the TN.

A narrator might change the TN of an attack based on environmental or narrative factors. For example, if one character is balancing on a tight-rope while attempting to strike another character, the TN to hit might be higher than the target’s AR. This can be balanced out by the attacking character having relevant proficiencies, such as acrobatics.

**A character's Armor Rating is equal to 10 + their Lung UP + their proficiency with the type of armor they are wearing + rating of their equipped armor (differs between every piece/set of armor)**.

>Depending on the type of story you are telling, it might not make sense to keep track of hit points based on the Skin proficiency. A story about plague and disease might make more sense to measure one's immune system by basing HP on Gut, or a story about politicians attempting to win a campaign might make more sense to base HP on Problem Solving or Speechcraft.
>Furthermore, some stories may have certain scenes when Skin HP doesn’t make sense, and certain scenes when it does. The rules are meant to be changed to fit the story, so do so as necessary.

## Rest

Rest isn't just important for keeping a body healthy, but it is also important in the flow of a story. Depending on the type of story being told, you may find it unnecessary to keep track of your character’s health and rest. If it is necessary, **then your characters can stop for an 8 hour period 1/day for a rest. When they do so they recover 1HP. If a character goes over 24 hours without resting, that character is no longer allowed to add proficiencies to their proficiency rolls until they finally do take an 8 hour rest**.
