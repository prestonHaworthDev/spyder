## Just the Bold Points
Throughout the rulebook I have formatted the most important information in bold and copied it here. Please read the rulebook in its entirety, then you can skim for the bold points to find elaboration on specific rules.

**Spyder has a high emphasis on storytelling.**

**This system is targeted at players who have never played a role-playing game before.**

**no setting is assumed.**

**Spyder also doesn't assume the type of story being told.**

**It's never a problem to ignore certain rules or add your own.**

**There are two groups of players: "Players" and "Narrators"**

**A proficiency roll is when a player rolls a d20, and adds the result of that roll to all of the proficiencies their character has that are narratively relevant to that roll.**

**Each player character starts out with 20 Learning Points (LP).**

**Before the story begins, their respective players can freely spend those points on proficiencies.**

**Every character has 1 hit point.**

**Every character has a speed of 10 feet.**

**Every character can passively carry 60 lbs.**

**When a player makes a proficiency roll, they get to add the values of all the proficiencies they think are relevant to that roll, that means that the more broad and general proficiency is, the more valuable it is**

**The 12 universal proficiencies (UPs) are the most important.**

**Think of proficiencies like keywords that represent ideas. If the keyword or idea is relevant to the character's action, then the player can add that proficiency to the proficiency roll.**

**A single round of a paced challenge should play out like this:**

**1. All the players will take turns explaining what they are attempting to do.**

**2. The narrator will interpret the playersâ€™ desires, as well as the rest of the scene, and ask the players to make any rolls if necessary to achieve their goals.**

**3. The narrator will consider the outcome of those rolls, and describe how that round plays out.**

**4. If it is necessary to continue pacing the scene in this way, return to step 1.**

**HP represents the number of mortal wounds a character can survive without treatment.**

**A character's Max HP are equal to their "Base Hit Points" (Base HP) plus their Skin UP. Base HP start at 1 for all characters, but are increased by the "Base Hit Points" proficiency.**

**In order for a character to attack a target, they make a proficiency roll like all other rolls in the game.**

**A character's Armor Rating is equal to 10 + their Lung UP + their Armor's Rating (differs between every set of armor) + their proficiency with the type of armor they are wearing.**

**Your characters can stop for an 8 hour period 1/day for a rest. When they do so they recover 1HP. If a character goes over 24 hours without resting, that character is no longer allowed to add proficiencies to their proficiency rolls until they finally do take an 8 hour rest.**
