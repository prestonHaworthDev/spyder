> *Meet the Vanguard of Hope! A small group of friends who meets every week to play board games. This week Hazel brought a game she found on DriveThruRPG called Spyder. It's a relaxing alternative to the more complex and popular TTRPGs they've played in the past. She's already read the rules and thinks it's going to be a good fit for the group, so she printed out a copy and brought it to board game night!*

## Getting Ready
### Who's the Narrator?
At least one player must take the role of Naruto and be put in charge of mediation and executive decision. Decide who that is before anything else. The narrator will have final say on all decisions so make sure it's someone all the players can trust with that kind of authority.

> *The Vanguard elects Hazel to be the narrator of the story since she's already familiar with the rules, and has already put some thought into a few setting ideas.*

### What drives this story?
There is an opportunity to experiment with different story writing approaches. I won't go in depth here on the advantages or disadvantages of different story design, but a vague concept to consider is whether you want to play in a **Character driven story**, or a **Plot driven story.** Character driven stories are often considered more compelling, but more complex, while plot driven stories are much simpler and easier to follow, but may feel a little stricter. If your group decides to make the story character driven, then consider letting the players create their characters first, then come up with a story that best fits those characters. If you instead decide to make your story plot driven, the draft an idea for a plot first, and give your players guidelines to create characters that fit in that plot.

> *Hazel proposes the Vanguard takes a character driven approach to try to make the story more fun, but the rest of the group would rather play a plot driven game while they are learning since they are all so unfamiliar with the rules. After some thought, Hazel agrees and begins drafting a story proposal.*

## Narrator Tutorial: What's the Story?
Start by following the Story Proposal Guide, and drafting a Story Proposal. This will give your players an idea of what to expect from the story, and give them an opportunity to add any amendments to your idea. Remember you are playing a game, not writing a novel so try to keep your proposal brief. Only add the details necessary to guide your player's character creation decisions, or the decision of whether or not they want to play this story. If you decide for your story to be more character driven, let your players begin designing their characters before this step so that your setting is informed by the characters it is about.

> *Hazel opens the Story Proposal Helper and follows it copying her answers to a piece of paper.*
> 
> **Asthetic:** High Fantasy<br/>
> **Genre:** Fantasy Adventure<br/>
> **Mood:** Inspiring and Motivating<br/>
> **Plot Hook:** The local slime population has been getting out of control. The player characters are frustrated by the slimes everywhere and decide to band together and go figure out what's causing them to multiply so rapidly.<br/>
> **Threat Level:** Some combat with a small chance of character death, but the rolls will typically be weighted in the player's favor.<br/>
> **What happens at 0HP:** Your character is unconcious and considered bleeding out. If not treated and stabalized IMMEDIATELY, they are dead.<br/>
> **Additional or Optional Rules and Content:** Favorite UP, The Fantasy Proficiencies Archive For Spyder, and Simple Spells for Spyder<br/>
> **Starting LP:** 20<br/>
> **When will LP be granted:** At the end of every session, the players will get 2LP for attending.<br/>
> **When can LP be spent:** Only in-between sessions.<br/>
> **Trigger Warnings:** Possible violence and light blood and gore with described wounds. Nothing too detailed or grotesque. Maybe some suggestive content and flirting, but nothing overtly sexual.<br/>
>
> *Hazel has 2 more ideas and can't choose between the three, so she drafts a proposal for all 3 and lets the players decide which story they want to play. The above proposal is the one they all agreed on.*

## Player Tutorial: Character Creation!
Get a picture in your head of your character. Not just what they look like, but where they come from and what their values and desires are. Then ask, what are they good at? Spend your LP on the proficiencies that make the most sense for that character. It may be helpful to start with Universal Proficiencies, then get more specific from there. Also consider any supplements your group may be using such as any spells or abilities that also cost LP.

> *This is The Vanguard of Hope's first time playing Spyder, so Hazel granted everyone the default 20LP to spend on character creation. Gus gets excited about the idea of "Banjo," an empathitic country boy who learned magic from forest fairies to help on his parents' farm. Hazel has informed the group she is using the optional "Favorite UP" rule to allow each player to pick one UP to boost the cap up to 3LP. He looks at the 12 Universal Proficiencies.*

> * **Legs**
> * **Fingers**
> * **Lung**
> * **Gut**
> * **Skin**
> * **Problem Solving**
> * **Knowledge**
> * **Will**
> * **Awareness**
> * **Presence**
> * **Speechcraft**

> *Gus decides that it makes sense for Banjo's strongest UP to be Will, so he favorites it and put 3 of his 20 LP into Will. He also puts 1 point each into Arms, Skin, and Awareness. He now has 14LP left to spend on magic and other proficiencies. He looks at the supplement Hazel has chosen for magic spells and sees that the spells are really expensive. He decides to buy Water Manipulation and Mineral Manipulation for 6LP each so that he can till soil and water crops, but that only leaves him with 2LP left. He looks at the Proficiency Archive chosen by his narrator, and decides that what makes the most sense is for him to put his 2 remaining points into Agriculture.*
> *Gus begins filling out his character sheet, but he doesn't know what to put down for Hit Points, Armor Rating, or Speed!*
>
>  **Name:** Banjo<br/>
>  **Hit Points:**<br/>
>  **Armor Rating:**<br/>
>  **Speed:**<br/>
>  **LP:** 0<br/>
>  **Proficiencies:**<br/>
>  Will 3<br/>
>  Arms 1<br/>
>  Skin 1<br/>
>  Awareness 1<br/>
>  Agriculture 2<br/>
>  **Spells:**<br/>
>  Water Manipulation<br/>
>  Mineral Manipulation
>  
>  *Gus skims the rulebook for the words Hit Points, Armor Rating, and Speed, all of which he finds in bold explaining how they are calculated. Hit Points is 1 + his Skin proficiency, Armor Rating is 10 + his Lung proficiency, and Speed is 10 x his Legs proficiency + 10. Since he didn't put any points in Lung or Legs, only his HP is changed.*
>  
>  **Hit Points:** 2<br/>
>  **Armor Rating:** 10<br/>
>  **Speed:** 10
>  
>  *Gus decided to put Banjo's focus into the farming aspect of his character. That makes him relatively weak in any life-threatening circumstances. As a result if he ever finds himself in combat or some other survival situation, he will have to find creative ways to use his strengths as an advantage, or fall prey to his weaknesses.*

## The Story Begins!
It is the narrator's responsibility to set the stage for the player characters to meet, but it is the player's responsibility to take the narrators hooks and find a reason for their character to be involved in the story. In a character driven story this will feel more natural, as the characters are the reason for the plot, while in a plot driven story it might feel a little forced and awkward. That's okay. You are here because you want to play the game. Suspend your disbelief and make a reason for your character to be there, even if it doesn't make sense.

> *Hazel finds a fantasy lute playlist on her phone and lets it play quietly in the background as she describes the 4 player characters entering a tavern in the small village of Faekiss. The characters each take respective seats somewhere in the tavern as they over-hear the chef in the kitchen shout "more darn slimes!?" Gus recognizes the hook and describes Banjo rushing to the kitchen to investigate. Hazel describes the scene that Banjo and the other player characters find in the kitchen. Everybody takes turns improvising their parts of the story as described in the "How To Play" chapter of the rulebook. Gradually the Vanguard of Hope unfolds an exciting story full of laughs and memories that isn't artificially interrupted by complex rules, inane die rolls, or monotonous math. Now they are playing Spyder.*
